# Git Internals

The Git Internals project was created to utilize the Java Class Structure to simulate the Git version control system. The JDK version used was 8 and the JUnit version is 4. There are appropriate tests to test the functionality of the code will achieve what the assignment entailed.

The files are organized by the file name by implementing Comparable. The filename is converted to a hash for comparison. There is a Sorted Set that will verify that each file is unique(set). The object store defines 3 types of objectsâ€”blobs, trees, and commits, and how to handle those. Logs were created with two string methods to reproduce the messages you would receive when working with Git in the Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows).
